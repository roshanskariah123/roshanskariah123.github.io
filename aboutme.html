  <p class="about-text">
    Hi, I'm <strong>Roshan Skariah</strong>, a Software Developer and AI Enthusiast currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science at the <a href="https://www.washington.edu/">University of Washington</a>. My passion lies in leveraging cutting-edge technology to solve complex problems, whether it's building scalable AI systems or crafting intuitive user experiences.
  </p>

  <p class="about-text">
    During my time as a <strong>Machine Learning Software Developer Intern at Amazon</strong>, I engineered and launched an AI chatbot that delivers real-time machine insights and operational data. The chatbot, powered by <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/">AWS Bedrock</a>, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and LangChain frameworks, handled over 5,000 machine-related queries across 10+ extensive documents. My work boosted personnel productivity by ~6% at shipment facilities, developed a text-to-SQL feature for instant real-time machine insights, and created a data visualization tool for generating interactive dashboards across 15 parameters. I also authored a white paper on these initiatives, presenting to senior leadership to drive operational improvements.

  <p class="about-text">
    As an <strong>Undergraduate Researcher at the NOISE Electrical & Computer Engineering Lab</strong> at the University of Washington, I contributed to groundbreaking AI/ML research. My focus was on enhancing machine vision and optical encoding methods to improve data interpretation, speed, and precision. By developing and implementing two major models using PyTorch and TensorFlow, I improved classification accuracy by ~15%. Collaborating with faculty and graduate students, I worked on pioneering optical processing methods to advance machine learning computations.
  </p>

  <p class="about-text">
    At <strong>Biz3Tech IT Consulting Services</strong>, I had the honor of earning the "Intern of the Year" award for two consecutive years (2021 and 2022). As a <strong>Software Engineering Intern</strong>, I developed machine learning models for talent screening using Google's T5 and NLP, achieving ~85% candidate satisfaction for 200+ daily screenings. I revamped commission systems and package configurations, impacting over 1 million users, and created a CRM system managing 300+ clients, improving staff engagement through a Notion interface for 50 members. Additionally, I spearheaded projects with local IT firms that led to the creation of 15+ jobs.

  <p class="about-text">
    Beyond academics and professional endeavors, I enjoy exploring the intersection of technology and entrepreneurship. From developing AI-driven dashboards to innovating talent management systems, I aim to democratize information and empower others with actionable insights.
